# MÎ¼ Programming Language
* [Acknowledgements](https://github.com/CpalmerD20/Mu-Lang-Compiler/blob/main/thank_you.md) 
* [Language Tutorial](https://github.com/CpalmerD20/Mu-Lang-Compiler/blob/main/tutorial.md)

## Goals
Mu is designed with the intention of revisiting what it would mean to have a "human readable" programming language that is also a "joy to type".
* Keywords must have clear meaning
* Symbols and operators must have the same meaning given contextual keywords
* Keywords should be whole words that would not be expected to be names for user-defined variables, functions, or objects
* The language syntax and grammars should be relatively ergonomic.
